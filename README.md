### Weather App

This project was developed as part of BearTech's 5-Day Front-End Engineer Technical Task.
Users can:
- Search for the weather forecast at their selected location
- View the hourly forecast for the current day
- View a 7-Day forecast
- click on a weekday in the 7-Day Forecast to see more information about the weather at that specific day (same location) as well as the hourly forecast for that weekday.

The focus of this application is on modern, user-friendly and responsive design with widget-like scrolling interactions. The project planning documentation can be found in the public/planning directory.
